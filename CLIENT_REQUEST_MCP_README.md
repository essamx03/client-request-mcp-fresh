## Data Structure

### Client Request Fields
- `Id`: Salesforce record ID
- `Name`: Request name/title
- `Request_Type__c`: Type of request (picklist)
- `Information_Request__c`: The client's question/request
- `Information_Response__c`: Response to information requests
- `Response__c`: Structured JSON responses
- `Responded__c`: Boolean indicating if responded
- `Client__c`: Link to client account
- `Reason_For_Request__c`: Reason for the request
- `CreatedDate`: When the request was created

## Security Notes

- The server uses Salesforce access tokens for authentication
- All CORS headers are configured for cross-origin requests
- Request/response logging is implemented for debugging
- Error handling provides detailed feedback for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify Salesforce access token is valid
   - Check instance URL format
   - Ensure network connectivity

2. **No Requests Found**
   - Check Client_Request__c object permissions
   - Verify query filters are correct
   - Confirm data exists in Salesforce

3. **Response Failures**
   - Validate request ID format
   - Check user permissions for updates
   - Review field-level security settings

### Logs
Server logs all requests and errors to the console. Check the server output for debugging information.

## Development
